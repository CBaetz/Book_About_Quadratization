abstract = {The model of adiabatic quantum computation is a relatively recent model of quantum computation that has attracted attention in the physics and computer science communities. We describe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum circuit. This implies that the adiabatic computation model and the standard circuit-based quantum computation model are polynomially equivalent. Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models allows one to state the main open problems in quantum computation using well-studied mathematical objects such as eigenvectors and spectral gaps of Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {Quantum annealing has recently been used to determine the Ramsey numbers R(m,2) for 3 {\textless} m {\textless} 9 and R(3,3) [Bian et al. (2013) PRL 111, 130505]. This was greatly celebrated as the largest experimental implementation of an adiabatic evolution algorithm to that date. However, in that computation, more than 66{\%} of the qubits used were auxiliary qubits, so the sizes of the Ramsey number Hamiltonians used were tremendously smaller than the full 128-qubit capacity of the device used. The reason these auxiliary qubits were needed was because the best quantum annealing devices at the time (and still now) cannot implement multi-qubit interactions beyond 2-qubit interactions, and they are also limited in their capacity for 2-qubit interactions. We present a method which allows the full qubit capacity of a quantum annealing device to be used, by reducing multi-qubit and 2-qubit interactions. With our method, the device used in the 2013 Ramsey number quantum computation could have determined R(16,2) and R(4,3) with under 10 minutes of runtime.},

@article{Tanburn2015c,
abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing has recently been used to factor 56153 [Dattani {\&} Bryans, arXiv:1411.6758] at room temperature, which is orders of magnitude larger than any number attempted yet using Shor's algorithm (circuit-based quantum computation). However, this number is still vastly smaller than RSA-768 which is the largest number factored thus far on a classical computer. We address a major issue arising in the scaling of adiabatic quantum factorization to much larger numbers. Namely, the existence of many 4-qubit, 3-qubit and 2-qubit interactions in the Hamiltonians. We showcase our method on various examples, one of which shows that we can remove 94{\%} of the 4-qubit interactions and 83{\%} of the 3-qubit interactions in the factorization of a 25-digit number with almost no effort, without adding any auxiliary qubits. Our method is not limited to quantum factoring. Its importance extends to the wider field of discrete optimization. Any CSP (constraint-satisfiability problem), psuedo-boolean optimization problem, or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization) problem can in principle benefit from the "deduction-reduction" method which we introduce in this paper. We provide an open source code which takes in a Hamiltonian (or a discrete discrete function which needs to be optimized), and returns a Hamiltonian that has the same unique ground state(s), no new auxiliary variables, and as few multi-qubit (multi-variable) terms as possible with deduc-reduc.},
