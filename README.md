## Contribution Guidelines
When contributing, please bear in mind the following guidelines:
- Update the .bib file with any references you add, rather than referencing your own .bib files. This way the pdf can be properly compiled by anyone.
- Write each sentence of LaTeX on a new line - this works better with git's version control.
- When adding a citation to the .bib file, please add it to the Mendeley group. This is certainly not required but is appreciated.
